## Description

This is a basic fictional website for a bakery, which comes with a buggy custom module.
Students must fix the module, add their own custom module and a Zen sub-theme.

I have corrected the buggy custom modules that came with errors. I also populated the custom 'quiz' module with appropriate questions. Finally, I created two custom themes to choose from. One, a sub theme of the base theme Zen, is a more traditional, clean theme that a traditional bakery might like. The other (which was built from scratch) is a little weirder and might appeal to a very specific type of company.
