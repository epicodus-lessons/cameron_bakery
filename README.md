# Cameron's Bakery

##### Epicodus Drupal Code Review 3

#### By Jayeson Kiyabu and Diane Douglas

## Description

This is a basic fictional website for a bakery, which comes with buggy custom modules.
I must fix the greeting and quiz modules, add my own custom module and a Zen sub-theme.

## Setup

* Clone this repository
* Set document root to the top level directory of the repository
* Import the database, called "bakery", found in `sites/db-backup`
* Create a user for the database: username = "cameron", password = "cameron"
* Point browser to localhost
* Site maintenance account info: username = "cameron", password = "cameron"

## Planning

* Fix greeting module
* Fix quiz module.  Quiz will ask the user 3 questions and have 3 possible outcomes
* Create Zen sub-theme
* Create custom theme from scratch
